# GraphSAGELite
A general inductive framework that leverages node feature information (e.g., text attributes) to efficiently generate node embeddings for previously unseen data. Instead of training individual embeddings for each node, GraphSAGE learn a function that generates embeddings by sampling and aggregating features from a nodeâ€™s local neighborhood
